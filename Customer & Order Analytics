#2. How many of those orders were for an iPhone? 
SELECT COUNT(orderid) from BIT_DB.JanSales WHERE Product="iPhone";

#3. Select the customer account numbers for all the orders that were placed in February. 
SELECT customers.acctnum, FebSales.orderID FROM customers
INNER JOIN FebSales
ON customers.order_id=FebSales.orderID;

#4. Which product was the cheapest one sold in January, and what was the price? 
SELECT distinct Product, price
FROM BIT_DB.JanSales
WHERE  price IN (SELECT MIN(price) FROM BIT_DB.JanSales);

#5. What is the total revenue for each product sold in January?
SELECT SUM(quantity)*price AS revenue,product
FROM BIT_DB.JanSales
GROUP BY product;

#6. Which products were sold in February at 548 Lincoln St, Seattle, WA 98101, how many of each were sold, and what was the total revenue?
SELECT SUM(Quantity), product, (SUM(quantity)*price) AS revenue
FROM BIT_DB.FebSales 
WHERE location = "548 Lincoln St, Seattle, WA 98101"
GROUP BY product;

#7. How many customers ordered more than 2 products at a time, and what was the average amount spent for those customers? 
SELECT COUNT (customers.acctnum), AVG(price*Quantity)
FROM customers
RIGHT JOIN FebSales
ON customers.order_id=FebSales.orderID
WHERE FebSales.Quantity >2;

#8. List all the products sold in Los Angeles in February, and include how many of each were sold.
